## What is GitHub?

Wikipedia says GitHub

> "...provides **hosting** for **software development version control** using
> **Git**"

- **hosting** = centralized place to put stuff
- **software development** = mostly for code, but can contain other things as
  well
- **version control** = sophisticated time machine
- **Git** underlying software

Fun fact. Octocat is the mascot of GitHub https://octodex.github.com/ 



## What is Git?

Wikipedia says Git is a

> "...**distributed** version-control system for **tracking changes** in source
> code during software development"

- **distributed** = each person has a copy and can contribute in spread out way
- **tracking changes** = another word for sophisticated time machine

**Note:** Key difference between Git and GitHub is the former is on your
computer and the latter is on the internet with Git as the backbone.


## Key terminology and actions

- **Repo(sitory)** = folder or project on GitHub
- **Fork** = creating copy of someone else's repository to contribute to
- **Branch** = create alternate timeline 
- **Commit** = make changes to timeline
- **Stage** = prepare changes to be added to your timeline
- **Push/Pull** = update GitHub files or files locally


## Workflow for working with GitHub

- Create and name GitHub repository
- Clone repository to your computer
- Add files
- Commit changes
- Push changes to GitHub


## Minimal commands to learn

```
git status              # See status of repository

git pull                # Update local files
  
git checkout            # Switch timelines

git add <file_name>     # Add file to be staged

git commit -m "Summary" # Commit changes

git push                # Update files on GitHub
```
